## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell

3. The script launches a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can:
   - Set the base frequency (Hz)
   - Set the beat frequency (Hz)
   - Adjust the volume
   - Choose between constant or alternating delta modes
   - Start and stop the binaural beats playback
